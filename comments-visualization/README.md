- Install [MySQL Connector/Python Developer Guide](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/index.html)

- If you want to get a random name in the help, also install the [names](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/names/) package

> pip install names

- run the script to see the help

>comments.py 

- get hold of your database host, username, database and password
- run the script with the appropiate options
